Using the gen
etic code, 
translate the sequence into amino acids, and 
assign a value
 (S, N, or M)
 to each site in the 
starting
 sequence 
– either 
a change in the nucleotide
 at 
each
 site will be 
synonymous
 (“S”), nonsynonymous
 (“N”), or mixed (“M”).  If changing the base at a site DEFINITELY 
changes the amino acid encoded, it counts as nonsynonymous.  
If changing the base at a site 
DEFINITELY DOESN’T change the amino acid encoded, it counts as synonymous (you ONLY find 
these at
 the 3
rd codon position). 
 If changing the base SOMETIMES changes the amino acid but 
sometimes doesn’t, it counts as mixed.  Most mixed sites are at the 3
rd codon position, but 
codons 
for 
leucine 
and 
arginine can have mixed sites at the 1
st position

2  CAG ACA CCG GGG  Calculate two values for each “mixed” site 
– the first value is the frequency with which a change in 
the “mixed” site would be synonymous (“S”), and the second value is the frequency with which a 
change in the “mixed” site would be nonsynonymous (“N”).  For
 the sequence above, the third 
base in the CAC codon is the only one that’s mixed 
– the third “C” could change either to an A, T, 
or G.  A change to “T” would be synonymous, while a change to “A” or “G” would be 
nonsynonymous
.  Thus this site is considered
 1/3 “S” and 2/3 “N.”
  * A Note *
 Most codons with a “mixed” third position occur in a 2/2 split between two amino acids, 
which is why we 
most often
 assign “mixed” sites a value of 2/3 N and 1/3 S.  However, the 
codons that code for isoleucine and methioni
ne are distributed differently 
– only ATG codes 
for methionine, while ATT, ATC, and ATA all code for isoleucine.  For this reason, if the 
ancestral codon was for methionine, it is counted as “N,” while if the ancestral codon was 
for isoleucine, it is count
ed as “M” and divided 2/3 S and 1/3 N.  
Calculations involving the 
codons for tryptophan and cysteine must be similarly adjusted, with the additional 
note
 that 
they share their first two bases with a stop codon as well
.  Add up the total number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, adding
 1 to each total for an N 
or S, and
 1/3 or 2/3
 to each total for 
a mixed site.  F
or the example above, we would have 
  Nonsynonymous = 
8 N’s + 1 M
 (2/3N) = 8.67
 nonsynonymous sites

ous = 
3 S’s + 1 M
 (1/3 S) = 3.33

  These are all the POSSIBLE 
differences
 that 
you could see
.  Now look at the 
differences
 that 
ACTUALLY 
APPEAR 
– they have been underlined in the sequence below
.  Synonymous 
differences
 are bold and green, w
hile nonsynonymous 
differences
 are bold and purple.  You can tell if they are 
synonymous or nonsynonymous based on the translation of the sequence
, which is why we don’t 
worry about whether or not things were “mixed” at this point 
– we’re not looking at th
e possible 
differences, but the ones that are found in the sequence
